                <p>Under FATCA, certain U.S. taxpayers holding financial assets outside the United States must report those assets to the IRS on Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets.

                <p>The IRS has three years from the due date of the tax return to assess any additional taxes that may be owed by issuing an Audit Letter. The IRS has the authority to examine the taxpayer's books, papers and other records that supports the items considered on your filed tax returns. It is always a good idea to keep the records that are relevant with respect to the filed tax returns for at least 3 years from the date on which you have filed your taxes.</p>
                <p>Taxpayer representation is the process of assisting our clients in dealing with various taxing authorities, negotiating payment plans or settlements, and in some cases, representing our clients in court. We represent clients on a variety of taxation issues and guide them through the dispute process ranging from a collection action to administrative appeals through litigation.</p>
                <p>The best person to represent you in tax matters before the IRS would be your CPA, your tax attorney, or an Enrolled Agent. This person would be very familiar with your tax return and be able to speak to the tax agencies about the issues in the tax preparation and filing.</p>
                <p><strong>Simplicon Tax Advisors LLP</strong> provides representation services if the taxpayer (Individual or Business Entity) receives any audit notice from the IRS regarding the previously filed tax returns. The taxpayer can write a Power of Attorney, Form 2848, appointing our Enrolled Agent or CPA to represent the case before the IRS, this Power of Attorney authorizes us to act in place of taxpayers in the tax matters.</p>
