IMPORTANT:
The "Failed to load members" error was caused by missing permission grants in the database schema.
I have updated 'supabase/schema.sql' to include the necessary GRANT statements.

PLEASE RUN THE UPDATED 'supabase/schema.sql' IN YOUR SUPABASE SQL EDITOR TO FIX THE PERMISSIONS.

This will authorize the application to read the Profiles, Submissions, and Messages tables.
